# HW8 - Off-Policy


Certainly! Let's design a small off-policy prediction problem. Off-policy learning is a type of reinforcement learning where the policy being learned about is different from the policy used to generate the data. In an off-policy prediction problem, we typically want to estimate the value of a state under a target policy, given data collected from a different behavior policy.

### Problem Setup

#### The Environment: 
- **Context**: A simple grid world environment.
- **Grid Size**: 4x4 grid.
- **States**: Each cell in the grid is a state.
- **Terminal States**: Top right (4,4) and bottom left (1,1) corners are terminal states.

#### The Target Policy (π):
- **Description**: The agent tries to reach the top right corner (4,4) from any starting position.
- **Action Selection**: 
  - 40% chance to move right (if not at the right edge).
  - 30% chance to move up (if not at the top edge).
  - Remaining 30% is split between moving left or down, if those actions are available.

#### The Behavior Policy (b):
- **Description**: A more exploratory policy used to generate the data.
- **Action Selection**:
  - Equal probability (25%) of moving in any of the four directions (up, down, left, right), irrespective of the position in the grid, unless the action would lead to hitting a wall (in which case, the probability is split equally among the remaining actions).

#### Rewards:
- **Structure**: -1 for each movement, +10 for reaching the terminal state (4,4).

#### Goal of the Problem:
- **Objective**: Using the data generated by the behavior policy (b), estimate the value of each state under the target policy (π).

### Data Collection:
- Generate episodes using the behavior policy (b), recording states, actions, and rewards.

### Prediction Task:
- **Method**: Use an off-policy prediction method like Importance Sampling or Q-learning to estimate the value of each state under the target policy (π) based on the data collected from the behavior policy (b).
- **Evaluation**: Compare the estimated values of states with a baseline or true values if known (can be computed for simple environments like this).

This small off-policy prediction problem provides a clear setup to understand the difference between the target and behavior policies and how off-policy learning can be used to estimate values of states under a different policy than the one used for data collection.
